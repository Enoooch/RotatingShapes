<p>All the things we see around are 3D shapes.  Some of them are nice looking, some of them you’d like to touch and squeeze. And when you look at things, you rotate them. But because its still quarantine, and i dont have many things around. I decided i would create some virtual things to rotate.  :-) Here what i ended up with:</p>
<video src="media/final.mp4" muted loop autoplay></video>
<h2>How to do that?</h2>
<p>To render everything i used Three.js, just like <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/01/26/twisted-colorful-spheres-with-three-js/">Mario Carillo in his amazing demo</a>, go check it out! Three.js is the best and most popular library to do things with WebGL at the moment. And if you are just starting your 3D path, it is definitely the easiest way to get something working.</p>

<p>If you just rotate shape, its nothing special, its just rotating.</p>
<video src="media/torus_simpl.mp4" muted loop autoplay></video>
<p>Interesting things start to happen when you rotate different parts of shape with different speeds. 
Let say i want top part of the object to rotate first, and than the rest, lets see whats going to happen.</p>
<video src="media/torus_distort.mp4" muted loop autoplay></video>
<p>To do this kind of things, you would need to use Vertex shader. I use a little bit of math and rotated parts of object depending on the Y or Z coordinate.  In terms of simplified code it looks like this:</p>
<pre>
vec3 newposition = rotate(oldPosition, angle*Y_COORDINATE);
</pre>
<p>So with coordinate change, rotation would change as well. The <code>rotate</code> function itself includes a lot of Sine-Cosine's and matrices. All the math you need to rotate point around some axis. </p>

<h2>Visuals, matcap</h2>
<p>To create a simple nice look for objects, we could have used lights and shadows and complicated materials. But because there were not so much on the scene, we got away with most simple kind of material: <a href=“https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/materials/MeshMatcapMaterial”>MatCaps</a>. So instead of complicated calculations, you just use a simple image to reference the lighting and color. Here is how it looks like:</p>
<img src="media/torus.jpg" alt="">

<p>And here is how Torus looks with this texture applied to it:</p>

<p>Amazing isnt it! And so simple.</p>

<h2>Final</h2>
<p>So combining matcaps and rotation method, i was able to create a lot of shapes that looks great, and have this rubber feeling, go check them all out!</p>

<p>Go and create your shape with this technique and there it with us! Hope this simple technique will inspire you to create your own animation!
Have a good day!</p>
